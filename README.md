# Roam Frontend Expo Workshop

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Checkout branch `workshop-starter`.

5. On your phone, install the Expo Go app from the App Store / Google Play.
6. Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code on the Expo dev tools page. The app should be installed on your phone and opened automatically.
7. You are now ready to start coding!
