# Roam Frontend Expo Workshop

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo to your machine.
2. Run `yarn` to install the dependencies.
3. Run `yarn start`. If you don't already have Expo CLI installed, accept the prompt to install it globally, the app should start up automatically once that is complete. The expo dev console should open in a chrome tab.
4. On your phone, install the Expo Go app from the App Store / Google Play.
5. Open the Expo Go app and scan the QR code on the Expo dev tools page. The app should be installed on your phone and opened automatically.
6. You are now ready to start coding!
